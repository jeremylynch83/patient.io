Diagnosing a Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) involves a series of tests and procedures to confirm the presence of a DAVF and to understand its size, location, and the exact pattern of abnormal blood flow.

## Medical History and Physical Examination

Your doctor will first take a detailed medical history, ask you about your symptoms, and perform a physical examination. They might also ask about any history of trauma, infection, or surgery, as these can sometimes be associated with DAVF.

## Imaging Tests

Several types of imaging tests can help visualize the blood vessels in the brain and detect any abnormalities. These include:

  - **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. MRI can often show evidence of DAVF or its effects on the brain or spinal cord.
  
  - **Computed Tomography (CT):** CT scans take X-ray images from multiple angles to create cross-sectional images of the brain. This can show abnormalities or changes in the brain that might suggest a DAVF.
  
  - **Digital Subtraction Angiogram:** This is an invasive test that involves injecting a dye into your blood vessels and taking X-ray images. The dye allows the visualisation of blood flow and can show the precise location and characteristics of a DAVF. This is considered the "gold standard" for diagnosing DAVF.
