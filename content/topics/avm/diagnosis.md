There are three primary imaging techniques used in the diagnosis and investigation of brain AVMs: computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebral angiography.

**Computed Tomography (CT)**

A CT scan is usually the initial imaging study performed when a patient is symptomatic. A CT scan is a type of X-ray that produces detailed cross-sectional images of the brain. It can suggest the approximate site of a bleed if one has occurred. 

For a more detailed view, a computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) may be performed. In a CTA, a contrast agent (a type of dye) is injected into the patient's bloodstream. The contrast agent helps to illuminate the blood vessels on the CT scan, providing a more detailed view of the AVM's structure.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**

MRI is more sensitive than CT in diagnosing AVMs and provides better information about the exact location of the malformation. MRI uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain and other structures. An MRI can provide a clear, detailed view of the brain's soft tissues, making it particularly useful in imaging AVMs. For even more detailed imaging, a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) can be performed, similar to a CTA, a contrast agent is injected into the bloodstream to highlight the blood vessels.

**Cerebral Angiography**

Cerebral angiography, sometimes also called a cerebral arteriogram, provides the most detailed images of a cerebral AVM. This procedure involves threading a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) through an artery in the arm or leg up to the arteries in the head. A contrast agent is then injected through the catheter. As the contrast agent flows through the blood vessels of the brain, a sequence of X-ray images are taken. These images can provide a highly detailed view of the AVM, showing the exact location, size, and the blood flow pattern.
