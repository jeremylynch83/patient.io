Spinal vascular malformations are uncommon conditions that involve abnormal connections between blood vessels in your spinal cord. They are essential to recognize because, if left undiagnosed and untreated, they can lead to serious complications. Symptoms can vary from person to person and can include pain, numbness, weakness, or difficulty moving your limbs. Bladder and bowel function can be impaired. The process of diagnosing these conditions is frequently prolonged due to the gradual onset of symptoms and limited awareness of the disease among non-expert practitioners. Radiological investigation can also be challenging as these conditions can resemble other non-vascular processes. 

There are a number of different types.


## Arteriovenous Fistulae

Arteriovenous fistulae form when there is a direct connection between an artery and a vein, bypassing the capillaries. This abnormal shunting of blood can put additional pressure on your heart and blood vessels and can deprive tissues of the necessary oxygen and nutrients, leading to various symptoms such as pain or numbness.


## Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs)

AVMs are a tangled web of arteries and veins with no capillaries in between. These abnormalities can disrupt normal blood flow and oxygen circulation, causing nearby tissues to suffer. Over time, these vessels can enlarge and rupture, leading to bleeding into the spinal cord. This can cause sudden pain and other neurological issues.


## Cavernous Malformations

Cavernous malformations, also known as cavernomas, are clusters of abnormal, tiny blood vessels and larger, dilated vessels filled with slow-moving blood. They can form anywhere in the body, but when they occur in the spinal cord, they can compress neural structures leading to pain, numbness, or weakness in your limbs.

## Capillary Telangiectasia

Capillary telangiectasia involves clusters of widened capillaries that do not have a normal vessel wall. While they are typically the least symptomatic of spinal vascular malformations, they can occasionally put pressure on the spinal cord, causing symptoms such as difficulty walking or loss of bowel or bladder control.
