Spinal vascular malformations can be challenging to diagnose due to their symptoms often mirroring those of other spinal conditions, such as spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, spinal stenosis, multiple sclerosis, or a spinal cord tumor.

To determine the cause of your symptoms, your doctor will likely recommend several tests, including:

   - **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** This imaging test uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of your spinal cord. An MRI can help identify abnormalities such as a mass resulting from irregularly connected blood vessels often seen in vascular malformations.

   - **Angiography:** This test is typically required to pinpoint the exact location and characteristics of the blood vessels involved in the malformation. During an angiography, a slender tube, known as a catheter, is inserted into an artery in the groin and carefully directed towards the spinal cord. A dye is then injected into the blood vessels in the spinal cord, making them visible under X-ray imaging. This helps provide a clearer picture of any vascular irregularities.
