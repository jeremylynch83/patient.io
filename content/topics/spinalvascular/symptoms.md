The symptoms of spinal vascular malformations can widely vary from person to person. They are largely dependent on the location and severity of the malformation. Some individuals may not experience noticeable symptoms for many years, or even at all, while others may endure symptoms that severely disrupt daily activities or present life-threatening risks.

These conditions typically present symptoms during early adulthood, but it's worth noting that a significant percentage of those diagnosed are under the age of 16.

The onset of symptoms can either be abrupt or gradual. Common initial symptoms often include:

   - Difficulty with walking or climbing stairs
   - Unexpected numbness, tingling, or sudden pain in the legs
   - Weakness affecting one or both sides of the body

As the condition worsens, additional symptoms might manifest, such as:

   - Sudden, severe back pain
   - Loss of sensation in the legs
   - Problems with urination or bowel movements
   - Headaches
   - A stiff neck
   - Increased sensitivity to light

Without timely and appropriate treatment, spinal vascular malformations can progressively lead to disability due to damage to the spinal cord and nearby tissues. Potential complications may include:

   - Difficulties with movement (motor deficits)
   - Pain, tingling sensations, and numbness (sensory deficits)
   - Deformities of the spinal column
   - Bulging of a blood vessel (aneurysm)
   - Increased blood pressure in the veins (venous hypertension), which can cause fluid accumulation (edema) and tissue death from lack of oxygen (spinal cord infarction)
   - Bleeding (hemorrhage), which can accelerate damage to the spinal cord
