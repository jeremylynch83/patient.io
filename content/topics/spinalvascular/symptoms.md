A brain aneurysm typically doesn't present symptoms until it's large or ruptures. However, it's crucial to recognise potential signs to seek timely medical help.

## Ruptured Brain Aneurysm

A ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency. Symptoms often include:

* Sudden, severe headache ("worst headache of your life")
* Neck stiffness or pain
* Light sensitivity (photophobia)
* Sudden blurred or double vision
* Sudden pain above or behind the eye
* Changes in mental status or awareness
* Difficulty walking or sudden dizziness
* Sudden weakness and numbness

## Unruptured Brain Aneurysm

Most aneurysms do not give any symptoms until they rupture. In rare instances unruptured aneurysms symptoms might include:

* Pain above and behind an eye
* Dilated pupil
* Vision changes (e.g., double vision)
* Facial numbness

If you experience any of these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. It's better to err on the side of caution when your health is concerned.
