A brain aneurysm typically doesn't present symptoms until it's large or ruptures. However, it's crucial to recognise potential signs to seek timely medical help.

## Ruptured Brain Aneurysm

A ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency. Symptoms may include:

* Sudden, severe headache ("worst headache of your life")
* Neck stiffness or pain
* Light sensitivity (photophobia)
* Sudden blurred or double vision
* Sudden pain above or behind the eye
* Changes in mental status or awareness
* Difficulty walking or sudden dizziness
* Sudden weakness and numbness

Most of the time aneurysm rupture is a serious and dramatic event that would be very noticeable to the patient. Commonly there is a severe headache, neck, pain, and sensitivity to light, which may be accompanied by loss of consciousness and patients are usually immediately brought to the hospital for further investigation and treatment.

Rarely, however, aneurysm rupture can produce less noticeable symptoms. Typically, there is still a severe headache. If you have any concerns you should immediately contact emergency medical services, especially if youâ€™re known to have a brain aneurysm.

## Unruptured Brain Aneurysm

Most aneurysms do not give any symptoms until they rupture. In rare instances unruptured aneurysms symptoms might include:

* Pain above and behind an eye
* Dilated pupil
* Vision changes (e.g., double vision)
* Facial numbness

If you experience any of these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. It's better to err on the side of caution when your health is concerned.
