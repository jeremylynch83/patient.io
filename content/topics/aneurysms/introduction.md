## What is an aneurysm?

An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel caused by a small area of weakness. Aneurysms can occur in various parts of the body, but one of the most common locations is the brain. These are known as intracranial or cerebral aneurysms. This bulge can lead to the rupture of the aneurysm, resulting in severe bleeding around the brain called subarachnoid haemorrhage. 

Brain aneurysms primarily affect middle aged and older  adults with a higher prevalence in women. They are extremely rare in children. The cause of aneurysms is unknown in most cases, although some individuals have a genetic predisposition to developing them. Aneurysms can also rarely develop after certain infections or trauma.

## What is the prevalence of brain aneurysms?

Brain aneurysms are present in about 3% of the population (3 in 100 people) [1]. There are some factors that increase this risk [2]: 



1. Family history of intracranial aneurysm or subarachnoid haemorrhage.
2. Atherosclerosis: This is a condition characterised by the buildup of plaque in the arteries. It is associated with an increased risk of brain aneurysms. Factors leading to atherosclerosis, such as smoking and high blood pressure, therefore also increase the risk. 
3. Female gender: Women have a higher risk of developing brain aneurysms compared to men.
4. Age: The risk of brain aneurysms may increase with age.
5. Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)
6. Sickle cell disease. 



## Are brain aneurysms dangerous?

Most aneurysms cause no symptoms or problems to an individual. 

Some aneurysms can, however, cause symptoms such as double vision, seizures, or strokes without rupturing. These effects are caused by inflammation or pressure on the surrounding brain, or due to the development of blood clots. 

The most serious consequence of aneurysms is sudden rupture and bleeding around the brain which is called subarachnoid haemorrhage.
