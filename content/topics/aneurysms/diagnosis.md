# How are aneurysms diagnosed?

There are a few tests, each of which has its advantages and disadvantages.



1. Computerised tomography (CT or CAT scan). This uses X-rays to image the body. It is widely accessible, quick, and is very useful to detect bleeding in or around the brain. The study can be done with or without 'contrast' dye. CT scans involve small amounts of radiation, doses which are not normally a significant risk to the patient.
2. CT angiography (CTA). This is a CT scan utilsing an injection of contrast dye to visualise the blood vessels. It is non-invasive, other than a small injection for the dye. 
3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This is a method of producing high resolution imaging of the body and blood vessels without the use of X-rays. Instead these scans use very strong magnets. They are slower and more expensive than CT scans, however, and cannot be performed in patients with certain (usually older) implanted metallic devices.
4. Cerebral angiography. This is a test using X-rays to produce very high resolution imaging and is the definitive method of identifying aneurysms. The patient will have a small incision in the groin or wrist and a tube is inserted into the blood vessels of interest. Dye is then injected through the tube.  The test is more invasive than MRI or CT/CTA and there is a small risk (less than 0.5%) of having a stroke.
